 * Text-GUI-Library - A C++11 alternative for ncurses
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Are you sick and tired of the old ncurses interface?\n
 * Do you just want to build an CLI application that has a decently usable GUI?\n
 * Are you dreaming of a modern OO-interface that is easy to use?\n\n
 *
 * **Worry no more!**\n
 * This library provides just that!\n\n
 *
 * Here are the features:
 * - Built for modern C++11
 * - Simple OO-API
 * - Expandable with custom classes and elements
 * - Minimal console output. (Only changed parts of the console will get printed)
 * - Customizable
